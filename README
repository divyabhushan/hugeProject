Readme file.
This project is to understand the git LFS(Large Filesystem Storage).
How Git manages, stores and retrieves the huge files.

Install 'git lfs' and declare the large files to be tracked as git lfs files.
Follow a normal git workflow procedure of adding,editing, committing and pushing the files(including the LFS files) to the remote repository.

The difference would be that LFS will be stored on a different storage and a pointer reference will alone be available from your Git server.
